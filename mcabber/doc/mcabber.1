.SH "NAME"
mcabber \- a simple Jabber (XMPP) console client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fImcabber\fR [ \-h | \-V | \-f configfile ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
mcabber(1) is a small Jabber (XMPP) console client\&. For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings\&.
.sp
You also need to have an existing Jabber account to use this software, as it cannot (un)register accounts yet\&.
.sp
Here are some of the features of mcabber:

.SH "WINDOWS/PANES"
.sp
The mcabber(1) screen is divided into 4 regions\&. The \fIroster\fR, alias \fIbuddylist\fR, is on the left\&. The \fIchat window\fR, or chat buffer, is on the right\&. The \fIinput line\fR lies at the bottom of the screen, under a small \fIlog window\fR\&.
.sp
Two status lines surround the log window\&. The bottom status line is the "main status line" and reflects mcabber general status\&. The other line is the "chat status line" and shows the status of the currently selected buddy\&.
.sp
To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter \fIchat mode\fR\&. You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC key\&. Simply sending a message will also enable chat mode\&.
.sp
There are several advantages to the two\-mode implementation: first, it allows accurate "unread" message functionality, as described in the next section; without this, merely scrolling to a specific buddy will "read" the new messages of all buddies in\-between\&. Second, it allows quickly hiding the conversation with a single keystroke\&. Third, it allows jumping between the few buddies with whom you are conversing with the \fI/roster alternate\fR command described in another section, without having to manually scroll back and forth\&.
.SH "KEYS"
.sp
Text typing occurs in the \fIinput line\fR; basic operations are supported (left arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace\&...)\&.
.sp
PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster\&.
.sp
Up and Down arrow keys can be used to move in the input line history; they jump to the previous/next line from the history beginning with the same string (from first column to the cursor column)\&.
.sp
To send a message, move to the chosen buddy in the buddylist, type your message and hit enter\&. If the line begins with a slash, this will be interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below)\&. Hit escape to leave the chat mode\&.

Additional key bindings may be specified using the \fI/bind\fR command described in the COMMANDS section\&.
.SH "MCABBER\(cqS ROSTER"
.sp
The first listed item on the roster is \fI[status]\fR, which keeps a log of everything that appears in the short log window below the main chat area\&. While the log window was designed for showing the latest few elements, the dedicated \fI[status]\fR buffer allows more comfortable viewing of the log, as well as scrolling it in a standard manner\&.
.sp
Group names are displayed above the items that are within them, and are indicated by \fI\-\-\-\fR to the left of the name\&.
.sp
For every real Jabber contact, the roster displays four pieces of information: the buddy\(cqs name or alias, its online status, its authorization status, and whether there are unread messages from the buddy waiting for you\&.
.sp
The online status is one of the following:
.PP
\fIo\fR
.RS 4
online
.RE
.PP
\fIf\fR
.RS 4
free for chat
.RE
.PP
\fIa\fR
.RS 4
away
.RE
.PP
\fIn\fR
.RS 4
not available (labeled
\fIextended away\fR
in some clients)
.RE
.PP
\fId\fR
.RS 4
do not disturb
.RE
.PP
\fI_\fR
.RS 4
offline (or invisible to you)
.RE
.PP
\fI?\fR
.RS 4
unknown, usually meaning you are not authorized to see this buddy\(cqs status
.RE
.PP
\fIx\fR
.RS 4
a conference room in which you are not participating
.RE
.PP
\fIC\fR
.RS 4
a conference room in which you are participating
.RE
.sp
The authorization status indicates whether a buddy is authorized to receive your online status updates, and is displayed by the brackets surrounding the buddy\(cqs online status\&. Square brackets, like \fI[o]\fR, indicate that this buddy is authorized to receive your status\&. Curly braces, like \fI{o}\fR, indicate that they are not authorized to receive your status\&.
.sp
When there are unread messages from a buddy which you have not looked at, a hash mark (\fI#\fR) appears in the leftmost section of the roster for that buddy\&. The hash mark disappears once you view that buddy\(cqs message buffer\&. When the user attention is requested (or when you receive a message containing your nickname in a MUC room), the hash mark is replaced with the \fIattention sign\fR, an exclamation mark (\fI!\fR)\&.
.sp
Examples:
.PP
\fI\-\-\- Buds\fR
.RS 4
This is a group named
\fIBuds\fR
.RE
.PP
\fI#[o] John\fR
.RS 4

.RE
.PP
\fI{?} Sally\fR
.RS 4
Neither you nor Sally have authorized each other to see your online status
.RE
.PP
\fI{a} Jane\fR
.RS 4
Jane is away, but she cannot see your online status
.RE

subcommand enables multi\-line mode\&. Note that it allows a message subject to be specified\&.

The
\fIverbatim\fR
multi\-line mode disables commands, so that it is possible to enter lines starting with a slash\&. Only the "/msay" command (with send or abort parameters) can be used to exit verbatim mode\&.

The
\fItoggle\fR
subcommand can be bound to a key to use the multi\-line mode quickly (for example, "bind M13 = msay toggle" to switch using the Meta\-Enter combination)\&.

.RS 4
Sets either the default policy or the policy for the given jid The plain policy should never be used, because you won\(cqt be able to receive or send any OTR encrypted messages\&. If you set the policy to manual, you or your chat partner have to start the OTR encryption by hand (e\&.g\&. with /otr start)\&. The policy "opportunistic" does that itself by sending a special whitespace\-sequence at the end of unencrypted messages\&. So the other OTR\-enabled chat client knows, that you want to use OTR\&. Note that the first message will always be unencryted, if you use this policy\&. With the policy "always" no message will be sent in plain text\&. If you try to sent the first message unencrypted, mcabber will try to establish an OTR channel\&. Please resend your message, when you get the information that the channel was established\&. If someone sends you plaintext messages while the policy is set to "always", you\(cqll be able to read the message but it won\(cqt be saved to the history\&.
