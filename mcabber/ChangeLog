mcabber (0.6.7)

   (which allows connecting to Google Talk).
   The libjabber patch (credited to Ian Johannesen) comes from centericq.
 * Reduce CPU consumption when mcabber is not connected to a Jabber server
 * Update libjabber (sync with upstream)
 * Fix a weird crash when trying to connect to a closed port

mcabber (0.6.6)

 * Use Glib for UTF-8 conversions
 * A screen resize does not terminate auto-away
 * Ctrl-l does a full screen refresh
 * Ctrl-c is treated as a normal key; we're now using ncurses raw mode
   so it doesn't trigger a signal
 * Speed up history file loading

 -- Mikael, 2005-08-17

mcabber (0.6.5)

 * Add Debian directory for packaging, create an experimental package
 * Add a few external actions (MSG OUT, STATUS *)
   The contrib/eventcmd script has been updated
 * Use better messages for server connection states
 * [FIX] Fix a segfault when starting mcabber in a really small terminal
 * Fix some history log directory issues
 * - Check history directory permissions and configuration file permissions
     They are corrected automatically (to 700 and 600)
   - Warn when mcabber main directory ($HOME/.mcabber) has bad permissions
 * First Ctrl-c didn't really leave multi-line message mode! (merge issue)
 * Add "/buffer search_backward"  and "/buffer search_forward", to search
   for a string in a buffer window
 * Add "/roster up" and "/roster down" commands
 * New logging system.  The "debug" file has been replaced by a "trace file",
   and 2 levels are available.  In level 1, the messages from the log window
   are written to te trace file.  In level 2, debug messages and XML are
   written to the file.  See the sample configuration file.
 * A few other internal changes and minor bugfixes
