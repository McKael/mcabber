BUGS:

* Presence notification is always accepted.
* Messages in hidden (shrunk) groups are not visible.
  Maybe we should create "*_msg_[gs]etflag()" functions, which
  would update groups message flags too. (?)


TODO:

* Display status
* show (how?) we can scroll in roster if not all buddies are displayed
* Get timestamp for offline messages
* /connect /disconnect ?
* Key bindings (ex: F5 <-> /group toggle)
* Pending message not displayed if buddy outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).

* Commands! :-)
