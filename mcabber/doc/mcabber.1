.SH "NAME"
mcabber \- a simple Jabber console client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fImcabber\fR [ \-f configfile ] [ \-\-help | \-h ]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
mcabber(1) is a small Jabber console client. For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings.
You also need to have an existing Jabber account to use this software, as it cannot (un)register accounts yet.
Here are some of the features of mcabber:

.SH "WINDOWS/PANES"
The mcabber(1) screen is divided into 4 regions. The \fIroster\fR, alias \fIbuddylist\fR, is on the left. The \fIchat window\fR, or chat buffer, is on the right. The \fIinput line\fR lies at the bottom of the screen, under a small \fIlog window\fR.
Two status lines surround the log window. The bottom status line is the "main status line" and reflects mcabber general status. The other line is the "chat status line" and shows the status of the currently selected buddy.
To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter \fIchat mode\fR. You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC key. Simply sending a message will also enable chat mode.
There are several advantages to the two\-mode implementation: first, it allows accurate "unread" message functionality, as described in the next section; without this, merely scrolling to a specific buddy will "read" the new messages of all buddies in\-between. Second, it allows quickly hiding the conversation with a single keystroke. Third, it allows jumping between the few buddies with whom you are conversing with the \fI/roster alternate\fR command described in another section, without having to manually scroll back and forth.
.SH "KEYS"
Text typing occurs in the \fIinput line\fR; basic operations are supported (left arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace\&...).
PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster.
Up and Down arrow keys can be used to move in the input line history; they jump to the previous/next line from the history beginning with the same string (from first column to the cursor column).
To send a message, move to the choosen buddy in the buddylist, type your message and hit enter. If the line begins with a slash, this will be interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below). Hit escape to leave the chat mode.
Here is a quick description of the key bindings:

.SH "MCABBER'S ROSTER"
The first listed resource on the roster is \fI[status]\fR, which keeps a log of everything that appears in the short log window below the main chat area. While the log window was designed for showing the latest few elements, the dedicated \fI[status]\fR buffer allows more comfortable viewing of the log, as well as scrolling it in a standard manner.
Group names are displayed above the resources that are within them, and are indicated by \fI\-\-\-\fR to the left of the name.
For every real Jabber resource, the roster displays four pieces of information: the resource's name or alias, its online status, its authorization status, and whether there are unread messages from the resource waiting for you.
The online status is one of the following:

T}:T{
unknown, usually meaning you are not authorized to see this resource's status
T}
T{
\fIx\fR
T}:T{
a conference room in which you are not participating
T}
.TE

The authorization status indicates whether a resource is authorized to receive your online status updates, and is displayed by the brackets surrounding the resource's online status. Square brackets, like \fI[o]\fR, indicate that this resource is authorized to receive your status. Curly braces, like \fI{o}\fR, indicate that they are not authorized to receive your status.
When there are unread messages from the resource which you have not looked at, a hash mark (\fI#\fR) appears in the leftmost section of the roster for that resource. The hash mark disappears once you view that resource's message log.

/bind [keycode [= command line]]
.RS 3n
Bind a command line to the key with the "keycode" code number. Keycodes of unused keys are displayed by
mcabber
in the log window when pressing the key, for example "Unknown key=265". "/bind keycode" displays the command line bound to the given keycode; "/bind keycode =" unbinds the given keycode. "/bind" displays a list of the bound keycodes. Note: aliases can be used in key bindings. Example: "/bind 265 = status online" (265 is F1 for me, but it may depend on your ncurses installation).

/msay begin|verbatim|send|send_to|toggle|toggle_verbatim|abort
.RS 3n
Send a multi\-line message. To write a single message with several lines, the

should be used. In multi\-line mode, each line (except command lines) typed in the input line will be added to the multi\-line message. Once the message is finished, it can be sent to the current selected buddy with the "/msay send" command (or Ctrl\-d). The
\fIbegin\fR
subcommand enables multi\-line mode. Note that it allows a message subject to be specified. The
\fIverbatim\fR
multi\-line mode disables commands, so that it is possible to enter lines starting with a slash. Only the "/msay" command (with send or abort parameters) can be used to exit verbatim mode. The
\fItoggle\fR
and
\fItoggle_verbatim\fR
subcommands can be bound to a key to use the multi\-line mode quickly (for example, "bind M109 = msay toggle" to switch using the Meta\-m combination).
