BUGS:



TODO:

* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...
* UTF-8 support (Can somebody help me?)
* Display status / chat mode
* /connect /disconnect ?
* Pending message flag is not displayed when buddy is outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Buddy buffer in full width (handy for cut'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Create .mcabber and .mcabber/histo dirs if needed.
* Search for a user
* Get info from server about a user
* Publish personal information
* Handle message type "error"
* Show status changes in buddy window (if open)?
* Auto away (it would be better to add the "message" variable first, which could
  be changed with "/set message = I'll be back!")
  Messages variables:
  - message_{online,avail,free,dnd,busy,notavail,away,autoaway}
  - message (current message)
* Maybe Ctrl-c should not (immediately) quit mcabber.  What about:
  - 1 Ctrl-c leaves completion/multi-line modes
  - 2 Ctrl-c in less than 2 seconds leave mcabber
* Keep track of buddy resources.  Ex.:
  - buddy A connects with resource r1
  - buddy A connects with resource r2
  - A/r2 disconnects
  Then we see A as being offline, although we should still see A/r1 online

* File transfer? :)
* Conferences

* Commands:

  - /alias alias = command
  - /set option = value
  - /bind $keynum = command
    Ex.: "/bind 269 = /group toggle"  Map F5 to group toggle
  - /bind $keynum = command
    Ex.: "/bind 269 = /group toggle"  Map F5 to group toggle
  - /buffer <clear|top|bottom>
    + /buffer % 50          (jump to 50 %)
    + /buffer date $date    (jump to first msg after $date)
    + /buffer search $string
      (backward or forward? maybe search_backward/search_forward)
  - /group <expand|shrink|toggle>
    + rename
  - /say_to <jid> blabla
  - /nick (I don't know if it makes sense for Jabber)
    I think it is equivalent to setting the "away" message.
  - /info [jid]
  - /server connect|disconnect|register|unregister
  - /auth request|send [jid]
  - Common status shortcuts: /away, /online, /busy, /dnd
    I'm not sure it's worth it, with tab completion it is easy and fast to
    type anyway.  We'd better use user-defined aliases.
  - /search <jid>|name
  - /help
  - /rawxml...
