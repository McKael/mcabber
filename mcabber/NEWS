mcabber (0.6.2-dev)

 * Support for old style (i.e. < 0.6.1) history logfiles has been removed.
   You can upgrade your logfiles with the script "contrib/conv_log_dates.pl"
   if you haven't already done it.
 * The colors option names have changed (and they aren't mandatory anymore).
   Please look at the sample config. file to update your mcabberrc.
