# Note about this file syntax:
# - Leading and trailing spaces are ignored.
# - Empty lines and lines beginning with a '#' are ignored.

# The jid will be the following: username@server
# If your jid's domain name is different from the server name,
# you can specify your complete jid as username.
#
# If password is not given, it will be interactively asked for.
# If port is not given, default Jabber port will be used.
# Use ssl = 1 to enable SSL

# enclose it with quotes: set password = " example password "

# This nickname is used when joining a room, when no nick is explicitly
# specified by the user.  Note that when the nickname option is not set,
# the username variable can be used.

# Proxy
# mcabber can use a proxy if it supports the CONNECT method
# The proxy_user/proxy_pass variables are optional.

# History logging
# You can save the messages history: set logging = 1

# Default logging directory (logging_dir) is $HOME/.mcabber/histo/

# your OS version

# External command for events
# You can specify a script or process to be launched when an event occurs.
#
# If 'event_log_files' is set, a file is created and contains the body of
# the message (incoming messages only); the file name is the last parameter.
# If you enable this, you can specify the directory mcabber will use to
# create these messages with the 'event_log_dir' variable (default is the
# system temp dir, or MCABBERTMPDIR environment variable).  Please note
# that mcabber won't delete these files, it's your script's job.
#
# The command is called the following way:
#   $events_command MSG IN jabber@id [file] (when receiving a message)
#   $events_command MSG OUT jabber@id       (when sending a message)
#   $events_command MSG MUC room_id [file]  (when receiving a MUC message)
#   $events_command STATUS X jabber@id      (new buddy status is X)
# See sample script in contrib/ directory.

# Traces logging
# If you want advanced traces, please specify a file and a level here.
# There are currently 2 traceloglog levels:
#  lvl 1: most events of the log window are written to the file
#  lvl 2: debug logging (XML, etc.)
# Default is level 0, no trace logging
#set tracelog_level = 1
#set tracelog_file = /home/mikael/mcabber.log

# Set the auto-away timeout, in seconds.  If set to a value >0,
# mcabber will change your status to away if no real activity is detected
# (command, message, move in the buddylist...).  Note: auto-away only changes
# the status when it is "available" (online) or "free_for_chat".
# See 'message_autoaway' below.

# isn't defined, the status message will stay unchanged.
