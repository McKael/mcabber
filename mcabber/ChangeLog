mcabber (0.6.4-dev)

 * [FIX] Convert status messages to/from UTF-8
 * The /status command can specify a status message

 * One Ctrl-C does not terminate mcabber anymore (the 2nd Ctrl-C do), but
   leaves multi-line message mode and aborts current completion

   a message is received)
 * New autoaway feature (see sample config. file)
