BUGS:

* We should display a warning when we can't write (any more) logs
  (bad dir, no space left...)
* Colors are misnamed
* Buggy (or inexistent) color setup makes (m)cabber crash


TODO:

* Multi-line "verbatim" mode (with commands disabled)
* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...
* Resource priority
* UTF-8 support
* Display status / chat mode
* /connect /disconnect ?
* Key bindings (ex: F5 <-> /group toggle)
* Pending message flag is not displayed when buddy is outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Buddy buffer in full width (handy for cut'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Create .mcabber and .mcabber/histo dirs if needed.
* Search for a user
* Get info from server about a user
* Publish personal information
* Handle message type "error"
* Show status changes in buddy window (if open)?
* Auto away
* Ctrl-o

* File transfer? :)
* Conferences

* Commands! :-)
