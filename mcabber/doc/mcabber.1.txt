NAME
----
mcabber - a simple Jabber console client

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mcabber' [ -f configfile ] [ --help | -h ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`mcabber(1)` is a small Jabber console client. +
For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample
mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings.

The `mcabber(1)` screen is divided into 4 regions.
The 'roster', alias 'buddylist', is on the left.  The 'chat window', or chat
buffer, is on the right.  The 'input line' lies at the bottom of the screen,
under a small 'log window'.

To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter 'chat mode'.
You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC
key.  Sending a message also enables chat mode implicitly.

Here are some of the features of `mcabber`:

- 'SSL support'.
- 'History logging:'  If enabled (see the CONFIGURATION FILE section),
  `mcabber(1)` can save discussions to history log files.
- 'Commands completion:'  If possible, `mcabber(1)` will try to complete your
  commands line if you hit the Tab key.
- 'External actions:'  Some events (like receiving a message) can trigger an
  external action, for example a shell script (you need to enable it in your
  configuration file).

OPTIONS
-------
--help, -h::
        Quick help usage message

-f configfile::
        Use configuration file 'configfile'

KEYS
----

Text typing happens in the 'input line'; basic operations are supported (left
arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace...).

PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster.

To send a message, move to the choosen buddy in the buddylist, type your
message and hit enter.  If the line begins with a slash, this will be
interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below).  Hit escape to
leave the chat mode.

Here is a quick description of the key bindings:

Ctrl-a::        Go to the beginning of the input line
Ctrl-e::        Go to the end of the input line
Ctrl-l::        Force a resize
PgUp/PgDown::   Move inside the roster (buddylist)
Tab::           Complete current word, in the input line
Ctrl-g::        Cancel completion / ctrl-g
Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n:: Scroll up/down half a screen in the buffer window (chat mode)
Ctrl-u::        Delete from beginning of the line to the cursor
Ctrl-k::        Delete from the cursor to the end of line
Ctrl-w::        Backward kill word
Ctrl-t::        Transpose chars
Ctrl-q::        Jump to the next unread message (Not yet implemented)

        Add the 'jid' Jabber user to our roster, and send a notification

/buffer clear|top|bottom::
        The 'buffer' command manipulates the current buddy's buffer
