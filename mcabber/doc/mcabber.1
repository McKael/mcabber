.SH NAME
mcabber \- a simple Jabber console client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


mcabber [ \-f configfile ] [ --help | \-h ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


mcabber(1) is a small Jabber console client\&. For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings\&.


You also need to have an existing Jabber account to use this software, as it cannot (un)register accounts yet\&.


The mcabber(1) screen is divided into 4 regions\&. The \fIroster\fR, alias \fIbuddylist\fR, is on the left\&. The \fIchat window\fR, or chat buffer, is on the right\&. The \fIinput line\fR lies at the bottom of the screen, under a small \fIlog window\fR\&.


Two status lines surround the log window\&. The bottom status line is the "main status line" and reflects mcabber general status\&. The other line is the "chat status line" and shows the status of the currently selected buddy\&.


To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter \fIchat mode\fR\&. You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC key\&. Simply sending a message will also enable chat mode\&.


Here are some of the features of mcabber:

 External actions: Some events (like receiving a message) can trigger an external action, for example a shell script (you need to enable it in your configuration file)\&. A sample events script ("eventcmd") is provided with mcabber source code, in the contrib directory\&.

.SH "KEYS"


Text typing occurs in the \fIinput line\fR; basic operations are supported (left arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace...)\&.


PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster\&.


Up and Down arrow keys can be used to move in the input line history; they jump to the previous/next line from the history beginning with the same string (from first column to the cursor column)\&.


To send a message, move to the choosen buddy in the buddylist, type your message and hit enter\&. If the line begins with a slash, this will be interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below)\&. Hit escape to leave the chat mode\&.

Here is a quick description of the key bindings:

Ctrl\-a		Go to the beginning of the input line

Ctrl\-e		Go to the end of the input line

Ctrl\-l		Force a refresh

Up/Down     	Move in the input line history

PgUp/PgDown	Move inside the roster (buddylist)

Tab    		Complete current word, in the input line

Ctrl\-g		Cancel completion / ctrl\-g

Ctrl\-p/Ctrl\-n	Scroll up/down half a screen in the buffer window (chat mode)

Ctrl\-Left 	Move the cursor back to the start of the current or previous word

Ctrl\-Right	Move the cursor forward to the end of the current or next word

Ctrl\-u		Delete from beginning of the line to the cursor

Ctrl\-k		Delete from the cursor to the end of line

Ctrl\-w		Backward kill word

Ctrl\-t		Transpose chars

Ctrl\-o		Accept line and put the next history line in the input line (accept\-line\-and\-down\-history)

Ctrl\-q		Jump to the next unread message


.SH "COMMANDS"

.TP
\fB/add\fR [jid [nickname]]
Add the "jid" Jabber user to our roster (default group), and send a notification request to this buddy\&. If no nickname is specified, the jid is used\&. If no jid (or an empty string "") is provided or if jid is "\&.", the current buddy is used\&.

.TP
\fB/alias\fR name = command line
Add "name" as an alias for "command line"\&.

Aliases are expanded only once, thus they can not be chained\&. "/alias name" displays the value associated with the "name" alias; "/alias name =" unsets the "name" alias\&.

Example: "/alias away = status away"\&.

.TP
\fB/authorization\fR allow|cancel|request|request_unsubscribe [jid]
Manage the presence subscriptions\&.

If no jid is provided, the current buddy is used\&.

 \fBallow\fR  	allow the buddy to receive your presence updates

 \fBrequest\fR	request a subscription to the buddy's presence updates
 \fBrequest_unsubscribe\fR request unsubscription from the buddy's presence updates

.TP
\fB/bind\fR keycode = command line
Bind a command line to the key with the "keycode" code number\&.

Keycodes of unused keys are displayed by mcabber in the log window when pressing the key, for example "Unknown key=265"\&. "/bind keycode" displays the command line bound to the given keycode; "/bind keycode" unbinds the given keycode\&.

Note: aliases can be used in key bindings\&.

Example: "/bind 265 = status online" (265 is F1 for me, but it may depend on your ncurses installation)\&.

.TP
\fB/buffer\fR clear|top|bottom|date|%|search_backward|search_forward
The buffer command manipulates the current buddy's buffer (chat window)\&.

 \fBclear\fR      	clear the current buddy chat window

 \fBdown\fR [n]   	scroll the buffer down n lines (default: half a screen)
 \fBdate\fR date  	jump to the first line after the specified date in the chat buffer (date format: "YYYY\-mm\-dd[THH:MM:SS]", "\-" and ":" are optional)
 \fB%\fR n        	jump to position %n of the buddy chat buffer
 \fBsearch_backward\fR text	search for "text" in the current buddy chat buffer

.TP
\fB/del\fR
Delete the current buddy from our roster, unsubscribe from its presence notification and unsubscribe it from ours\&.

.TP
\fB/disconnect\fR
Terminate connection to the Jabber server\&. Note: the roster is only available when the connection to the server is active, so the buddylist is empty when disconnected\&.

.TP
\fB/event\fR #n|* accept|ignore|reject, \fB/event\fR list
Tell mcabber what to do about a pending event\&. If the first parameter is "*", the command will apply to all queued events\&.

 \fBreject\fR	reject the event #n
 \fBlist\fR	list all pending events

 \fBtoggle\fR	toggle the state (fold/unfold) of the current tree

.TP
\fB/move\fR [groupname]
Move the current buddy to the requested group\&. If no group is specified, then the buddy is moved to the default group\&. Tip: if the chatmode is enabled, you can use "/roster alternate" to jump to the moved buddy\&.

.TP
\fB/msay\fR begin|verbatim|send|send_to|toggle|toggle_verbatim|abort
Send a multi\-line message\&. To write a single message with several lines, the \fImulti\-line mode\fR should be used\&.

The \fIbegin\fR subcommand enables multi\-line mode\&. Note that it allows a message subject to be specified\&.

In multi\-line mode, each line (except command lines) typed in the input line will be added to the multi\-line message\&. Once the message is finished, it can be sent to the current selected buddy with the "/msay send" command\&.

The \fIverbatim\fR multi\-line mode disables commands, so that it is possible to enter lines starting with a slash\&. Only the "/msay" command (with send or abort parameters) can be used to exit verbatim mode\&.

The \fItoggle\fR and \fItoggle_verbatim\fR subcommands can be bound to a key to use the multi\-line mode quickly (for example, "bind M109 = msay toggle" to switch using the Meta\-m combination)\&.

 \fBbegin\fR [subject]	enter multi\-line mode
 \fBverbatim\fR       	enter verbatim multi\-line mode
 \fBsend\fR           	send the current multi\-line message to the currently selected buddy

.TP

 \fBjoin\fR [room [nick]] 	join "room", using "nick" as nickname\&. If no nickname is provided, the "nickname" option value is used (see sample configuration file)\&.

.TP
\fB/say_to\fR jid text

Show or set the current status\&.

If no status is specified, display the current status\&.
