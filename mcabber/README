Well, the documentation is missing yet, but...

!!!!!! SEE mcabberrc.example !!!!!!

configfile:
    The configfile will be placed in $HOME/.mcabberrc
    and it will be:
	
	    username = username
	    password = yourpassword
	    server = serveryou.use
	    resource = yourresourcenameOFFICE
	    passtype = plain  (or sha1)
	    

That's all folks! (by the moment ;-)
