 /SAY_TO [-n|-h] [-q] [-f file] jid text

Send the "text" message to the specified jid.
Please note that this command doesn't set the default resource for a contact, so if you want to send several messages to a specific resource you will have to use "/say_to" for each message.
The "-n" flag turns the message to "normal" type, "-h" to "headline".  "--" can be used to send chat messages beginning with -n or -h.
When "-q" is used, the message will be sent in the background and will not change the current active window.
A text file can be provided with the "-f" switch (in which case there's no need to pass a text argument after the jid, of course).
