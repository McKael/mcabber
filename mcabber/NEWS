mcabber (0.6.5)

 * The "debug" option has been replaced with the tracelog_level and
   tracelog_file options.  The sample config. file has been updated,
   so you should have a look at it if you want to use advanced logging.

mcabber (0.6.4)

 * The configuration file format has changed.  Options need to be set using
   the "set" keywords.  The sample config. file has been updated.

mcabber (0.6.2)

 * Support for old style (i.e. < 0.6.1) history logfiles has been removed.
   You can upgrade your logfiles with the script "contrib/conv_log_dates.pl"
   if you haven't already done it.
 * The colors option names have changed (and they aren't mandatory anymore).
   Please look at the sample config. file to update your mcabberrc.
