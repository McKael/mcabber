.SH NAME
mcabber \- a simple Jabber console client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


mcabber [ \-f configfile ] [ --help | \-h ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


mcabber(1) is a small Jabber console client\&. For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings\&.


You also need to have an existing Jabber account to use this software, as it cannot (un)register accounts yet\&.


Here are some of the features of mcabber:

.TP 3
\(bu
 SSL support\&.
.TP
\(bu
 MUC support (Multi\-User Chat)\&.
.TP
\(bu
 History logging: If enabled (see the CONFIGURATION FILE section), mcabber can save discussions to history log files\&.
.TP
\(bu
 Commands completion: If possible, mcabber will try to complete your command line if you hit the Tab key\&.
.TP
\(bu
 Input line history: Any message or command entered is in the input line history and can be reused easily\&.
.TP
\(bu
 External actions: Some events (like receiving a message) can trigger an external action such as a shell script if you enable it in your configuration file\&. A sample events script ("eventcmd") is provided with mcabber source code, in the contrib directory\&.
.LP

.SH "OPTIONS"

.TP
\-\-help, \-h

.SH "WINDOWS/PANES"


The mcabber(1) screen is divided into 4 regions\&. The \fIroster\fR, alias \fIbuddylist\fR, is on the left\&. The \fIchat window\fR, or chat buffer, is on the right\&. The \fIinput line\fR lies at the bottom of the screen, under a small \fIlog window\fR\&.


Two status lines surround the log window\&. The bottom status line is the "main status line" and reflects mcabber general status\&. The other line is the "chat status line" and shows the status of the currently selected buddy\&.


To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter \fIchat mode\fR\&. You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC key\&. Simply sending a message will also enable chat mode\&.


There are several advantages to the two\-mode implementation: first, it allows accurate "unread" message functionality, as described in the next section; without this, merely scrolling to a specific buddy will "read" the new messages of all buddies in\-between\&. Second, it allows quickly hiding the conversation with a single keystroke\&. Third, it allows jumping between the few buddies with whom you are conversing with the \fI/roster alternate\fR command described in another section, without having to manually scroll back and forth\&.

.SH "KEYS"


Text typing occurs in the \fIinput line\fR; basic operations are supported (left arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace...)\&.


PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster\&.


Up and Down arrow keys can be used to move in the input line history; they jump to the previous/next line from the history beginning with the same string (from first column to the cursor column)\&.


To send a message, move to the choosen buddy in the buddylist, type your message and hit enter\&. If the line begins with a slash, this will be interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below)\&. Hit escape to leave the chat mode\&.


Here is a quick description of the key bindings:

Ctrl\-a		Go to the beginning of the input line

Ctrl\-e		Go to the end of the input line

Ctrl\-l		Force a refresh

Up/Down     	Move in the input line history

PgUp/PgDown	Move inside the roster (buddylist)

Tab    		Complete current word, in the input line

Ctrl\-g		Cancel completion / ctrl\-g

Ctrl\-p/Ctrl\-n	Scroll up/down half a screen in the buffer window (chat mode)

Ctrl\-Left 	Move the cursor back to the start of the current or previous word

Ctrl\-Right	Move the cursor forward to the end of the current or next word

Ctrl\-u		Delete from beginning of the line to the cursor

Ctrl\-k		Delete from the cursor to the end of line

Ctrl\-w		Backward kill word

Ctrl\-t		Transpose chars

Ctrl\-o		Accept line and put the next history line in the input line (accept\-line\-and\-down\-history)

Ctrl\-q		Jump to the next unread message

Additional key bindings may be specified using the /bind command described
in the COMMANDS section\&.

.SH "MCABBER'S ROSTER"


The first listed resource on the roster is \fI[status]\fR, which keeps a log of everything that appears in the short log window below the main chat area\&. While the log window was designed for showing the latest few elements, the dedicated \fI[status]\fR buffer allows more comfortable viewing of the log, as well as scrolling it in a standard manner\&.


Group names are displayed above the resources that are within them, and are indicated by \fI\-\-\-\fR to the left of the name\&.


For every real Jabber resource, the roster displays four pieces of information: the resource's name or alias, its online status, its authorization status, and whether there are unread messages from the resource waiting for you\&.


The online status is one of the following:

 \fBo\fR	online
 \fBf\fR	free for chat
 \fBa\fR	away
 \fBn\fR	not available (labeled \fIextended away\fR in some clients)
 \fBd\fR	do not disturb
 \fBi\fR	invisible (displayed only for your resource)
 \fB_\fR	offline (or invisible to you)
 \fB?\fR	unknown, usually meaning you are not authorized to see this resource's status
 \fBx\fR	a conference room in which you are not participating
 \fBC\fR	a conference room in which you are participating


The authorization status indicates whether a resource is authorized to receive your online status updates, and is displayed by the brackets surrounding the resource's online status\&. Square brackets, like \fI[o]\fR, indicate that this resource is authorized to receive your status\&. Curly braces, like \fI{o}\fR, indicate that they are not authorized to receive your status\&.


When there are unread messages from the resource which you have not looked at, a hash mark (\fI#\fR) appears in the leftmost section of the roster for that resource\&. The hash mark disappears once you view that resource's message log\&.


Examples:

 \fB \-\-\- Buds\fR	This is a group named \fIBuds\fR
 \fB#[o] John\fR   	John is online, can see your status, and sent you a message that you did not read yet
 \fB {?} Sally\fR  	Neither you nor Sally have authorized each other to see your online status
 \fB {a} Jane\fR   	Jane is away, but she cannot see your online status
 \fB#[C] x@y\&.c\fR	You are participating in x@y\&.c conference room, and there are unread messages


.SH "COMMANDS RELATED TO MCABBER"

.TP
\fB/alias\fR name = command line
Add "name" as an alias for "command line"\&.

Aliases are expanded only once, thus they can not be chained\&. "/alias name" displays the value associated with the "name" alias; "/alias name =" unsets the "name" alias\&.

Example: "/alias away = status away"\&.

.TP
\fB/bind\fR keycode = command line
Bind a command line to the key with the "keycode" code number\&.

Keycodes of unused keys are displayed by mcabber in the log window when pressing the key, for example "Unknown key=265"\&. "/bind keycode" displays the command line bound to the given keycode; "/bind keycode" unbinds the given keycode\&.

Note: aliases can be used in key bindings\&.

Example: "/bind 265 = status online" (265 is F1 for me, but it may depend on your ncurses installation)\&.

.TP
\fB/buffer\fR clear|top|bottom|date|%|search_backward|search_forward
The buffer command manipulates the current buddy's buffer (chat window)\&.

 \fB%\fR n        	jump to position %n of the buddy chat buffer
 \fBsearch_backward\fR text	search for "text" in the current buddy chat buffer
 \fBsearch_forward\fR  text	search for "text" in the current buddy chat buffer

.TP

The clear command is actually an alias for "/buffer clear"\&.

.TP
\fB/quit\fR

.SH "COMMANDS RELATED TO THE SERVER AND CONNECTION"

.TP
\fB/connect\fR
Establish connection to the Jabber server\&.

.TP
\fB/disconnect\fR
Terminate connection to the Jabber server\&. Note: the roster is only available when the connection to the server is active, so the buddylist is empty when disconnected\&.

.TP
\fB/event\fR #n|* accept|ignore|reject, \fB/event\fR list
Tell mcabber what to do about a pending event\&. If the first parameter is "*", the command will apply to all queued events\&.

 \fBsend\fR string: send string (raw XML format) to the Jabber server\&. No check is done on the string provided\&. BEWARE! Use this only if you know what you are doing, or you could terminate the connection\&.

.SH "COMMANDS RELATED TO THE ROSTER AND JABBER RESOURCES"

.TP
\fB/add\fR [jid [nickname]]
Add the "jid" Jabber user to our roster (default group), and send a notification request to this buddy\&. If no nickname is specified, the jid is used\&. If no jid (or an empty string "") is provided or if jid is "\&.", the current buddy is used\&.

.TP
\fB/move\fR [groupname]

.TP
\fB/msay\fR begin|verbatim|send|send_to|toggle|toggle_verbatim|abort
Send a multi\-line message\&. To write a single message with several lines, the \fImulti\-line mode\fR should be used\&.

In multi\-line mode, each line (except command lines) typed in the input line will be added to the multi\-line message\&. Once the message is finished, it can be sent to the current selected buddy with the "/msay send" command\&.

The \fIverbatim\fR multi\-line mode disables commands, so that it is possible to enter lines starting with a slash\&. Only the "/msay" command (with send or abort parameters) can be used to exit verbatim mode\&.

The \fItoggle\fR and \fItoggle_verbatim\fR subcommands can be bound to a key to use the multi\-line mode quickly (for example, "bind M109 = msay toggle" to switch using the Meta\-m combination)\&.

 \fBbegin\fR [subject]	enter multi\-line mode
 \fBverbatim\fR       	enter verbatim multi\-line mode
