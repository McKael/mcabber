BUGS:

* /status_to, /say_to, and "/room privmsg" do not deal with resources
  containing spaces
* The PgUp and Ins keys do not work for some people
  Cannot reproduce, any help appreciated.

TODO:

* UTF-8 support (Can somebody help me?)
* Implement automatic reconnection after network failure
  Note: "New message" flags are currently lost on connection failure
* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...
* Display status / chat mode (a status line would be great)
* Pending message flag is not displayed when buddy is outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Buddy buffer in full width (useful for copy'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Publish personal information
* Show status changes in buddy window (if open)?
* Options completion
* MUC: advanced settings for room creation
* MUC: join password-protected room

* File transfer? :)

* Commands:

  - /group expand|shrink|toggle
    + rename
  - /info [jid]
    (request info to the server if the buddy is not in the roster)
  - /server register|unregister
  - /auth request|send [jid]
  - /search <jid>|name
    (server search)
  - /help
