BUGS:

* The PgUp and Ins keys do not work for some people
  Cannot reproduce, any help appreciated.

TODO:

* Implement automatic reconnection after network failure
* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...
* UTF-8 support (Can somebody help me?)
* Display status / chat mode
* Pending message flag is not displayed when buddy is outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Buddy buffer in full width (handy for copy'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Publish personal information
* Show status changes in buddy window (if open)?
* Options completion
* /rawxml: utf8-encode user's text
* MUC: invitation
* MUC: join password-protected room
* MUC: show who sends us a private anonymous message
* MUC: do not log private anonymous messages
* MUC: default to not logging (that's done), and add an option
* MUC: display buddies status changes (including join/leave)
* MUC: nickname completion
* MUC: get the room topic

* File transfer? :)
