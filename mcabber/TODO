BUGS:

* SSL certificate verification does not work with gnutls

* Connect hook
* Macros
* Use new Entity Time specs (XEP-0202) if possible in
 /request time.

  set.

* Enable /roster search for offline (hidden) buddies (hidden groups, etc.)
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Publish personal information
* MUC: advanced settings for room creation
* MUC: display roles of room members
