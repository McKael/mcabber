BUGS:

* We should display a warning when we can't write (any more) logs
  (bad dir, no space left...)


TODO:

* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...
* Resource priority
* UTF-8 support (Can somebody help me?)
* Display status / chat mode
* /connect /disconnect ?
* Key bindings (ex: F5 <-> /group toggle)
* Pending message flag is not displayed when buddy is outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Buddy buffer in full width (handy for cut'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Create .mcabber and .mcabber/histo dirs if needed.
* Search for a user
* Get info from server about a user
* Publish personal information
* Handle message type "error"
* Show status changes in buddy window (if open)?
* Auto away

* File transfer? :)
* Conferences

* Commands! :-)
  - /buffer <clear|top|bottom>
    + /buffer % 50          (jump to 50 %)
    + /buffer date $date    (jump to first msg after $date)
    + /buffer search $string
      (backward or forward? maybe search_backward/search_forward)
  - /group <expand|shrink|toggle>
    + rename
  - /say_to <jid> blabla
  - /nick                   (I don't know if it makes sense for Jabber)
  - /info [jid]
  - /server connect|disconnect|register|unregister
  - /auth request|send [jid]
  - Common status shortcuts: /away, /online, /busy, /dnd
    I'm not sure it's worth it, with tab completion it is easy and fast to
    type anyway.  We'd better use user-defined aliases.
  - /alias alias command
  - /search <jid>|name
  - /set option = value
  - /help
  - /rawxml...
