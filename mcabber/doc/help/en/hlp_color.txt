 /COLOR roster (status wildcard (color|-)|clear)

The 'color' command allows setting dynamic color properties of the screen.

/color roster clear
 Remove all color rules for the roster.
 All roster items will get its default color.
/color roster status wildcard color
 Set a color rule (or overwrite, if it already exists).
 The status is string containing all statuses the roster item can have for the
 rule to match, or * if any status is OK.
 Wildcard is the file-matching wildcard that will be applied to JID.
 Color is the wanted color.
 If color is -, the rule is removed.
 If more than one rule matches, the color from the last created (not overwritten) is used.
