* Implement automatic reconnection after network failure
* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...

  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).

* Buddy buffer in full width (useful for copy'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Publish personal information
* GPG support
* Colors for presence
* Improve the completion system
* Persistent room in the roster (join every connect)
* MUC: advanced settings for room creation
* MUC: join password-protected room
