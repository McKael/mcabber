# If your jid's domain name is different from the server name,

# Beep
# Set beep_on_message to 1 if you want mcabber to beep when receiving
# a new message (except in chatrooms).  If you want a more sophisticated

# External command for events
# You can specify a script or process to be launched when an event occurs.
#
# If 'event_log_files' is set, a file is created and contains the body of
# the message (incoming messages only); the file name is the last parameter.
# If you enable this, you can specify the directory mcabber will use to
# create these messages with the 'event_log_dir' variable (default is the
# system temp dir, or MCABBERTMPDIR environment variable).  Please note
# that mcabber won't delete these files, it's your script's job.
#
# The command is called the following way:
#   $events_command MSG IN jabber@id [file] (when receiving a message)
#   $events_command MSG OUT jabber@id       (when sending a message)
#   $events_command MSG MUC room_id [file]  (when receiving a MUC message)

# events_command.  If this option is set, mcabber will beep if the
# exit value is 2.
#set eventcmd_checkstatus = 0

# Traces logging
# If you want advanced traces, please specify a file and a level here.
# There are currently 2 traceloglog levels:
#  lvl 1: most events of the log window are written to the file
#  lvl 2: debug logging (XML, etc.)
# Default is level 0, no trace logging

# Set the auto-away timeout, in seconds.  If set to a value >0,
# mcabber will change your status to away if no real activity is detected
# (command, message, move in the buddylist...).  Note: auto-away only changes
# the status when it is "available" (online) or "free_for_chat".
# See 'message_autoaway' below.

# color settings.
