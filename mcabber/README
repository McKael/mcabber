 Hello, and thanks for trying mcabber.

For installation instructions, have a look at the INSTALL file.

A configuration file is necessary to start mcabber.  Its name is
$HOME/.mcabber/mcabberrc (or $HOME/.mcabberrc).

A sample configuration file, "mcabberrc.example", is provided in this
directory.  Copy it and modify it to fit your needs.

You can use mcabber "-f" option to specify another configuration file.


This software is under development, please give me some feedback (and some
patches if you can!).  Or just tell me you're using it... ;-)

There is a Mercurial repository on mcabber's website
 <http://www.lilotux.net/~mikael/mcabber/>
and a Jabber conference room: <jid:mcabber@conf.lilotux.net>.
