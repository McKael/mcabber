mcabber (0.6.0)

  Initial fork from cabber 0.5.0-test1
  Lots of changes, here is a quick summary:
  * Use automake/autoconf
  * Switch to libjabber
  * SSL support with OpenSSL (should work with gnutls but I didn't
    succeed)
  * History scrolling and resizing
  * History logging (and reading)
  * Small manpage (AsciiDoc documentation)
  * Buddy groups implementation
    - fold/unfold groups
    - hide/show offline buddies
  * Commands, and command completion system
  * Hooks for external events (for ex. when receiving a message)
