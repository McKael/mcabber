BUGS:



TODO:

* Improve debug logging system
* Implement automatic reconnection after network failure
* Presence notification is always accepted.  We should ask...
* UTF-8 support (Can somebody help me?)
* Display status / chat mode
* Pending message flag is not displayed when buddy is outside Contact window,
  maybe we could show it someway (maybe just a flag?).
* Show number of online contacts in folded groups
* Buddy buffer in full width (handy for copy'n paste!)
  (i.e. hide roster window)
* Publish personal information
* Show status changes in buddy window (if open)?
* Options completion
* Keep track of buddy resources.  Ex.:
  - buddy A connects with resource r1
  - buddy A connects with resource r2
  - A/r2 disconnects
  Then we see A as being offline, although we should still see A/r1 online

* File transfer? :)
* Conferences

* Commands:

  - /buffer <clear|top|bottom>
    + /buffer % 50          (jump to 50 %)
    + /buffer date $date    (jump to first msg after $date)
    + /buffer search $string
      (backward or forward? maybe search_backward/search_forward)
  - /group <expand|shrink|toggle>
    + rename
  - /say_to <jid> blabla
  - /info [jid]
    (request info to the server if the buddy is not in the roster)
  - /server register|unregister
  - /auth request|send [jid]
  - /search <jid>|name
    (server search)
  - /help
  - /rawxml...
