The 'roster' command manipulates the roster/buddylist.
Here are the available parameters:

/roster bottom
 Jump to the bottom of the roster
/roster top
 Jump to the top of the roster
/roster up [n]
 Move up [n lines] in the roster
/roster down [n]
 Move down [n lines] in the roster
/roster group_prev
 Jump to the previous group in the roster
/roster group_next
 Jump to the next group in the roster
/roster alternate
 Jump to alternate buddy.  The "alternate" buddy is the last buddy left while being in chat mode.  This command is thus especially useful after commands like "/roster unread_next" (Ctrl-q).
/roster unread_first
 Jump to the first unread message
/roster unread_next
 Jump to the next unread message
/roster search bud
 Search for a buddy with a name or jid containing "bud" (only in the displayed buddylist)
/roster display [mask]
 See or update the roster filter.
 The mask should contain the shortcut letters of the status you want to see ([o]nline, [f]ree_for_chat, [d]o_not_disturb, [n]ot_available, [a]way, [_]offline).
 For example "ofdna" to display only connected buddies.
 "*" can be used as a shortcut to display all contacts.
/roster hide_offline
 Hide offline buddies (same as /roster display ofdna)
/roster show_offline
 Show offline buddies (same as /roster display ofdna_)
/roster toggle_offline
 Toggle display of offline buddies
/roster item_lock [jid]
 Lock the roster item so it remains visible regardless of its status
/roster item_unlock [jid]
 Undo the effects of item_lock
/roster item_toggle_lock [jid]
 Invert the current lock flag
/roster hide
 Hide roster (full-width chat window)
/roster show
 Show roster
/roster toggle
 Toggle roster visibility
/roster note [-|text]
 Set/update/delete an annotation.
 If there is no text, the current item's annotation is displayed -- if you are in the status buffer, all notes are displayed.
 If text is "-", the note is erased.
/roster resource_lock [full jid|resource]
 Set active resource for a buddy in roster. Accepts special jid "./resource" for current buddy, or just a resource name.
/roster resource_unlock [jid]
 Unset active resource for a buddy. Accepts special jid "." for current buddy.
