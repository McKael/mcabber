mcabber (0.6.2-dev)

 * New multi-line "verbatim" mode (/msay verbatim).  In this mode, all
   commands but /msay are disabled, so that lines beginning with a slash
   can be sent
 * Ctrl-o (accept-line-and-down-history) has been added
 * Add "/roster search jid|name" to look for somebody in the current buddylist
 * Color configuration handling improvement
   NOTE: configuration file needs to be updated; see sample config. file!
 * Resource priority can be set (see sample config. file)
 * mcabber now warns when logging is enabled and there is a write error while
   writing to log files
