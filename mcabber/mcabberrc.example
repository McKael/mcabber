# The jid will be the following: username@server
# If your jid's domain name is different from the server name,
# you can specify your complete jid as username.

# If password is not given, it will be interactively asked for.
# If port is not given, default Jabber port will be used.

# Beep

# External command for events

# the message (incoming messages only); the file name is the last parameter.
# If you enable this, you can specify the directory mcabber will use to
# create these messages with the 'event_log_dir' variable (default is the
# system temp dir, or MCABBERTMPDIR environment variable).  Please note
# that mcabber won't delete these files, it's your script's job.
#
# The command is called the following way:
#   $events_command MSG IN jabber@id [file] (when receiving a message)
#   $events_command MSG OUT jabber@id       (when sending a message)
#   $events_command MSG MUC room_id [file]  (when receiving a MUC message)

# events_command.  If this option is set, mcabber will beep if the
# exit value is 2.

# Traces logging
# If you want advanced traces, please specify a file and a level here.
# There are currently 2 traceloglog levels:

# Set the auto-away timeout, in seconds.  If set to a value >0,
# mcabber will change your status to away if no real activity is detected

# the status when it is "available" (online) or "free_for_chat".
# See 'message_autoaway' below.

# Set 'delete_on_reject' to 1 if you want to delete buddies from your
# roster when you reject their subscription request. (default: 0)

# so for example if you are subscribed to this buddy's presence updates it
# won't be deleted.
