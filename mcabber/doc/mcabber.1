.SH NAME
mcabber \- a simple Jabber console client
.SH "SYNOPSIS"


mcabber [ \-f configfile ] [ --help | \-h ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"


mcabber(1) is a small Jabber console client\&. For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings\&.


The mcabber(1) screen is divided into 4 regions\&. The \fIroster\fR, alias \fIbuddylist\fR, is on the left\&. The \fIchat window\fR, or chat buffer, is on the right\&. The \fIinput line\fR lies at the bottom of the screen, under a small \fIlog window\fR\&.


To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter \fIchat mode\fR\&. You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC key\&. Sending a message also enables chat mode implicitly\&.


Here are some of the features of mcabber:
