NAME
----
mcabber - a simple Jabber (XMPP) console client

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mcabber' [ -h | -V | -f configfile ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`mcabber(1)` is a small Jabber (XMPP) console client. +
For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample
mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings.

You also need to have an existing Jabber account to use this software, as
it cannot (un)register accounts yet.

Here are some of the features of `mcabber`:

- 'SASL/SSL/TLS support'.
- 'MUC support' (Multi-User Chat).
- 'PGP, OTR support'
- 'Chat States' support (typing notifications)
- 'History logging:'  If enabled (see the CONFIGURATION FILE section),
  `mcabber` can save discussions to text history log files.
- 'Commands completion:'  If possible, `mcabber` will try to complete your
  command line if you hit the Tab key.
- 'Input line history:'  Any message or command entered is in the input line
  history and can be reused easily.
- 'External actions:'  Some events (like receiving a message) can trigger an
  external action such as a shell script if you enable it in your
  configuration file.  A sample events script ("eventcmd") is provided with
  `mcabber` source code, in the contrib directory.
- 'Modules:'  `mcabber` can load modules (a.k.a. plugins) at runtime that
  extend its features.

OPTIONS
-------
-h::
        Quick help usage message

-V::
        Displays `mcabber` version and compile-time definitions.

-f configfile::
        Use configuration file 'configfile'

WINDOWS/PANES
-------------
The `mcabber(1)` screen is divided into 4 regions.
The 'roster', alias 'buddylist', is on the left.  The 'chat window', or chat
buffer, is on the right.  The 'input line' lies at the bottom of the screen,
under a small 'log window'.

Two status lines surround the log window.  The bottom status line is the
"main status line" and reflects mcabber general status.  The other line
is the "chat status line" and shows the status of the currently selected
buddy.

To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter 'chat mode'.
You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC
key.  Simply sending a message will also enable chat mode.

There are several advantages to the two-mode implementation: first, it allows
accurate "unread" message functionality, as described in the next section;
without this, merely scrolling to a specific buddy will "read" the new
messages of all buddies in-between.  Second, it allows quickly hiding the
conversation with a single keystroke.  Third, it allows jumping between
the few buddies with whom you are conversing with the '/roster alternate'
command described in another section, without having to manually scroll
back and forth.

KEYS
----
Text typing occurs in the 'input line'; basic operations are supported
(left arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace...).

PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster.

Up and Down arrow keys can be used to move in the input line history; they
jump to the previous/next line from the history beginning with the same string
(from first column to the cursor column).

To send a message, move to the chosen buddy in the buddylist, type your
message and hit enter.  If the line begins with a slash, this will be
interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below).  Hit escape to
leave the chat mode.

Here is a quick description of the default key bindings:

Esc::           Disable chat mode
Ctrl-a::        Go to the beginning of the input line
Ctrl-e::        Go to the end of the input line
Ctrl-l::        Force a refresh
Up/Down::       Move in the input line history
PgUp/PgDown::   Move inside the roster (buddylist)
Tab::           Complete current word, in the input line
Ctrl-g::        Cancel completion
Ctrl-c::        Abort multi-line messages and completions
Ctrl-d::        Send/terminate a multi-line message
Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n:: Scroll up/down half a screen in the buffer window (chat mode)
Ctrl-Left::     Move the cursor back to the start of the current or previous word
Ctrl-Right::    Move the cursor forward to the end of the current or next word
Ctrl-u::        Delete from beginning of the line to the cursor
Ctrl-k::        Delete from the cursor to the end of line
Ctrl-w::        Backward kill word
Ctrl-t::        Transpose chars
Ctrl-o::        Accept line and put the next history line in the input line (accept-line-and-down-history)

Additional key bindings may be specified using the '/bind' command described
in the COMMANDS section.

MCABBER'S ROSTER
----------------
The first listed item on the roster is '[status]', which keeps a log of
everything that appears in the short log window below the main chat area.
While the log window was designed for showing the latest few elements, the
dedicated '[status]' buffer allows more comfortable viewing of the log, as
well as scrolling it in a standard manner.

Group names are displayed above the items that are within them, and are
indicated by '---' to the left of the name.

For every real Jabber contact, the roster displays four pieces of information:
the buddy's name or alias, its online status, its authorization status, and
whether there are unread messages from the buddy waiting for you.

The online status is one of the following:

        'o';;  online
        'f';;  free for chat
        'a';;  away
        'n';;  not available (labeled 'extended away' in some clients)
        'd';;  do not disturb
        '_';;  offline (or invisible to you)
        '?';;  unknown, usually meaning you are not authorized to see this buddy's status
        'x';;  a conference room in which you are not participating
        'C';;  a conference room in which you are participating

The authorization status indicates whether a buddy is authorized to receive
your online status updates, and is displayed by the brackets surrounding the
buddy's online status.  Square brackets, like '[o]', indicate that this
buddy is authorized to receive your status.  Curly braces, like '\{o\}',
indicate that they are not authorized to receive your status.

When there are unread messages from a buddy which you have not looked at,
a hash mark ('#') appears in the leftmost section of the roster for that
buddy.  The hash mark disappears once you view that buddy's message
buffer.
When the user attention is requested (or when you receive a message containing
your nickname in a MUC room), the hash mark is replaced with the 'attention
sign', an exclamation mark ('!').

Examples:

        ' --- Buds';;     This is a group named 'Buds'
        '#[o] John';;     John is online, can see your status, and sent you a message that you did not read yet
        ' \{?\} Sally';;  Neither you nor Sally have authorized each other to see your online status
        ' \{a\} Jane';;   Jane is away, but she cannot see your online status
        '#[C] \x@y.c';;   You are participating in \x@y.c conference room, and there are unread messages

COMMANDS
--------
Please refer to the online help (command /help), it is probably more up-to-date than this manpage.  Furthermore, help files have been translated into several languages. +
You will find an overview of the `mcabber` commands in this manual.

/color roster (status wildcard (color|-)|clear)::
/color mucnick nick (color|-)::
/color muc (jid|.|*) [on|preset|off|-]::
        The 'color' command allows setting dynamic color properties of the screen.

        'mucnick' nick (color|-);;  Marks the nick to be colored by given color.  If a MUC has colored nicks, this one will be used.  If color is -, the color is marked as chosen automatically, which means it will not be used in 'preset' coloring mode, but will stay the same in 'on' coloring mode.
        'muc' (jid|.|*) [on|preset|off|-];;  Sets a MUC nick coloring mode.  If a jid (. means currently selected jid) is provided, the mode will apply to this specific MUC.  If * is used, it will be applied to all MUCs, except the ones set by their jid. Mode 'on' colors all nicks, 'preset' only the ones manually set by /color mucnick command and 'off' colors none.  If not specified, defaults to 'on'.  Mode '-' removes the mode from given JID, which means the global one will apply.  You can not remove the global mode. Default global coloring mode is 'off'.

        Display "message" in the log window.

/event #n|* accept|ignore|reject [event-specific arguments]::
/event list::
        Tell mcabber what to do about pending events. +

        For users, resources are displayed with the status, priority and status message (if available) of each resource.

/module load|unload [-f] module::
/module info module::
/module [list]::
        Load, unload or show info on module.

        'load' [-f] module;;  Loads specified module.  If -f flag is specified, most of module loading errors will be ignored.
        'unload' [-f] module;;  Unloads specified module. Note: The force flag will not remove any dependency on this module!
        'info' module;;  Shows available information about this module.

        Tip: if the chatmode is enabled, you can use "/roster alternate" to jump to the moved buddy.

/msay begin|verbatim|send|send_to|toggle|toggle_verbatim|abort::
        Send a multi-line message.  To write a single message with several lines, the 'multi-line mode' should be used. +
        In multi-line mode, each line (except command lines) typed in the input line will be added to the multi-line message.  Once the message is finished, it can be sent to the current selected buddy with the "/msay send" command. +
        The 'begin' subcommand enables multi-line mode.  Note that it allows a message subject to be specified. +
        The 'verbatim' multi-line mode disables commands, so that it is possible to enter lines starting with a slash.  Only the "/msay" command (with send or abort parameters) can be used to exit verbatim mode. +
        The 'toggle' subcommand can be bound to a key to use the multi-line mode quickly (for example, "bind M13 = msay toggle" to switch using the Meta-Enter combination).

        'begin' [subject];;  Enter multi-line mode
        'verbatim';;  Enter verbatim multi-line mode
        'send' [-n|-h];;  Send the current multi-line message to the currently selected buddy
        'send_to' [-n|-h] jid;;  Send the current multi-line message to "jid"
        'toggle'|'toggle_verbatim';;  Switch to/from multi-line mode (begin/send)
        'abort';;  Leave multi-line mode without sending the message

        The -n or -h flags turn the message to "normal" or "headline" accordingly, as opposed to default "chat" message.

/otr key::
/otr start|stop|info [jid]::
/otr fingerprint [jid [fpr]]::
/otr smpq|smpr [jid] secret::
/otr smpa [jid]::
        You can use the shortcut-jid "." for the currently selected contact.

        'key';;  Print the fingerprint of your private key to the Status Buffer
        'start' [jid];;  Open an OTR channel to the specified jid (or the currently selected contact)
        'stop' [jid];;  Close the OTR channel to the specified jid (or the currently selected contact)
        'info' [jid];;  Show current OTR status for the specified jid (or the currently selected contact)
        'fingerprint' [jid [fpr]];;  Show the active fingerprint of an OTR channel. If the fingerprint is provided instead of "fpr", the fingerprint will become trusted.  If you replace "fpr" by some bogus string the fingerprint will loose the trusted status.
        'smpq' [jid] secret;;  Initiate the Socialist Millionaires Protocol with the secret and the buddy
        'smpr' [jid] secret;;  Respond to the Initiation of the jid with the secret
        'smpa' [jid];;  Abort the running Socialist Millionaires Protocol

/otrpolicy::
/otrpolicy (default|jid) (plain|manual|opportunistic|always)::
        You can use the shortcut-jid "." for the currently selected contact.

        (without arguments);;  Prints all OTR policies to the status buffer
        ('default'|'jid') (plain|manual|opportunistic|always);;  Sets either the default policy or the policy for the given jid The plain policy should never be used, because you won't be able to receive or send any OTR encrypted messages. If you set the policy to manual, you or your chat partner have to start the OTR encryption by hand (e.g. with /otr start). The policy "opportunistic" does that itself by sending a special whitespace-sequence at the end of unencrypted messages.  So the other OTR-enabled chat client knows, that you want to use OTR.  Note that the first message will always be unencryted, if you use this policy. With the policy "always" no message will be sent in plain text.  If you try to sent the first message unencrypted, mcabber will try to establish an OTR channel.  Please resend your message, when you get the information that the channel was established.  If someone sends you plaintext messages while the policy is set to "always", you'll be able to read the message but it won't be saved to the history.

/pgp disable|enable|force|info [jid]::
/pgp setkey [jid [key]]::
        This command manipulates PGP settings for the specified jid (by default the currently selected contact). +
        Please note that PGP encryption won't be used if no remote PGP support is detected, even if PGP is enabled with this command.  You can force PGP encryption with the "force" subcommand.

        'disable' [jid];;  Disable PGP encryption for jid (or the currently selected contact)
        'enable' [jid];;  Enable PGP encryption for jid (or the currently selected contact)
        [+|-]'force' [jid];;  Enforce PGP encryption, even for offline messages, and always assume the recipient has PGP support.  If a message can't be encrypted (missing key or key id), the messages won't be sent at all.  This option is ignored when PGP is disabled.
        'info' [jid];;  Show current PGP settings for the contact
        'setkey' [jid [key]];;  Set the PGP key to be used to encrypt message for this contact. If no key is provided, the current key is erased. You can use the shortcut-jid "." for the currently selected contact.

/quit::
        This command closes all connections and quit mcabber.

/rawxml send string::
        Send "string" (raw XML format) to the Jabber server. +
        No check is done on the string provided. +
        BEWARE!

        Example: "/rawxml send <presence><show>away</show></presence>"

/rename name::
        Rename the current buddy or group to the given "name".  If "name" is -, the name is removed from the roster (and mcabber will display the JID or username).

/request last|ping|time|vcard|version [jid]::
        Send a "IQ" query to the current buddy, or to the specified Jabber user.  If the resource is not provided with the jid, mcabber will send the query to all known resources for this user.

        'last';;  Request "last" information (usually idle time)
        'ping';;  Send an XMPP Ping request.  Note that you should use the full JID since a ping sent to a bare JID will be handled by the server.
        'time';;  Request time from the buddy
        'vcard';;  Request VCard from the buddy
        'version';;  Request version from the buddy

        The 'roster' command manipulates the roster/buddylist. +
        Here are the available parameters:

        'bottom';;  Jump to the bottom of the roster
        'top';;  Jump to the top of the roster
        'up' [n];;  Move up [n lines] in the roster
        'down' [n];;  Move down [n lines] in the roster
        'group_prev';;  Jump to the previous group in the roster
        'group_next';;  Jump to the next group in the roster
        'alternate';;  Jump to alternate buddy.  The "alternate" buddy is the last buddy left while being in chat mode.  This command is thus especially useful after commands like "/roster unread_next" (Ctrl-q).
        'unread_first';;  Jump to the first unread message
        'unread_next';;  Jump to the next unread message
        'search' bud;;  Search for a buddy with a name or jid containing "bud" (only in the displayed buddylist)
        'display' [mask];;  See or update the roster filter. The mask should contain the shortcut letters of the status you want to see ([o]nline, [f]ree_for_chat, [d]o_not_disturb, [n]ot_available, [a]way, [_]offline). For example "ofdna" to display only connected buddies.
        'hide_offline';;  Hide offline buddies (same as /roster display ofdna)
        'show_offline';;  Show offline buddies (same as /roster display ofdna_)
        'toggle_offline';;  Toggle display of offline buddies
        'item_lock' [jid];;  Lock the roster item so it remains visible regardless of its status
        'item_unlock' [jid];;  Undo the effects of item_lock
        'item_toggle_lock' [jid];;  Invert the current lock flag
        'hide';;  Hide roster (full-width chat window)
        'show';;  Show roster
        'toggle';;  Toggle roster visibility
        'note' [-|text];;  Set/update/delete an annotation. If there is no text, the current item's annotation is displayed -- if you are in the status buffer, all notes are displayed. If text is "-", the note is erased.

/say [-n|-h|--] text::
        Send the "text" message to the currently selected buddy.  It can be useful if you want to send a message beginning with a slash, for example. +
        The "-n" flag turns the message to "normal" type, "-h" to "headline".  "--" can be used to send chat message beginning with -n or -h.

/say_to [-n|-h] [-q] [-f file] jid text::
        Send the "text" message to the specified jid. +
        Please note that this command doesn't set the default resource for a contact, so if you want to send several messages to a specific resource you will have to use "/say_to" for each message. +
        You can send a message to a specific resource of the currently selected contact by using /say_to ./resourcename message. +
        The "-n" flag turns the message to "normal" type, "-h" to "headline".  "--" can be used to send chat messages beginning with -n or -h. +
        When "-q" is used, the message will be sent in the background and will not change the current active window. +
        A text file can be provided with the "-f" switch (in which case there's no need to pass a text argument after the jid, of course).

/screen_refresh::
        Refresh the mcabber screen.

/set [option [= value]]::
        Display or set an option value. +
        Without arguments prints a list of all set options with their values

/source pattern::
        Read configuration files, that match glob pattern (sorted in alphabetical order).

/status [online|avail|free|dnd|notavail|away [-|statusmessage]]::
/status message -|statusmessage::
        Show or set the current status. +
        If no status is specified, display the current status. +
        If a status message is specified, it will overrride the message* variables (these variables can be set in the configuration file). +
        If no relevant message* variable is set and no status message provided, the current status message is kept. +
        If StatusMessage is "-", the current status message is cleared. +
        With the "/status message" command, mcabber will update the message while preserving the status.

/status_to jid online|avail|free|dnd|notavail|away [statusmessage]::
/status_to jid message statusmessage::
        Send the requested status to the specified Jabber user. +
        If the specified jid is ".", the current buddy is used. +
        Note: this status will be overridden by subsequent "/status" commands.  If you are using the auto-away feature, the status will overridden too. +
        Note: The jid can include a resource (i.e. \user@server/resource).

/version::
        Display current version of mcabber.
