NAME
----
mcabber - a simple Jabber console client

SYNOPSIS
--------
'mcabber' [ -f configfile ] [ --help | -h ]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
`mcabber(1)` is a small Jabber console client. +
For now it needs a configuration file to start, so please copy the sample
mcabberrc file and adapt your connection settings.

The `mcabber(1)` screen is divided into 4 regions.
The 'roster', alias 'buddylist', is on the left.  The 'chat window', or chat
buffer, is on the right.  The 'input line' lies at the bottom of the screen,
under a small 'log window'.

To display buddies chat buffers, you will have to enter 'chat mode'.
You can enter chat mode by pressing enter, and leave chat mode with the ESC
key.  Simply sending a message will also enable chat mode.

Here are some of the features of `mcabber`:

- 'SSL support'.
- 'History logging:'  If enabled (see the CONFIGURATION FILE section),
  `mcabber(1)` can save discussions to history log files.
- 'Commands completion:'  If possible, `mcabber(1)` will try to complete your
  command line if you hit the Tab key.
- 'External actions:'  Some events (like receiving a message) can trigger an
  external action, for example a shell script (you need to enable it in your
  configuration file).

OPTIONS
-------
--help, -h::
        Quick help usage message

-f configfile::
        Use configuration file 'configfile'

KEYS
----

Text typing occurs in the 'input line'; basic operations are supported
(left arrow, right arrow, home/end keys, insert, delete, backspace...).

PageUp and PageDown keys are used to move in the roster.

To send a message, move to the choosen buddy in the buddylist, type your
message and hit enter.  If the line begins with a slash, this will be
interpreted as a command (see the COMMAND section below).  Hit escape to
leave the chat mode.

Here is a quick description of the key bindings:

Ctrl-a::        Go to the beginning of the input line
Ctrl-e::        Go to the end of the input line
Ctrl-l::        Force a resize
PgUp/PgDown::   Move inside the roster (buddylist)
Tab::           Complete current word, in the input line
Ctrl-g::        Cancel completion / ctrl-g
Ctrl-p/Ctrl-n:: Scroll up/down half a screen in the buffer window (chat mode)
Ctrl-u::        Delete from beginning of the line to the cursor
Ctrl-k::        Delete from the cursor to the end of line
Ctrl-w::        Backward kill word
Ctrl-t::        Transpose chars
Ctrl-q::        Jump to the next unread message

COMMANDS
--------

/add jid [nickname]::
        Add the 'jid' Jabber user to our roster (default group), and send a
        notification request to this buddy.  If no nickname is specified, the
        jid is used.

/buffer clear|top|bottom::
        The 'buffer' command manipulates the current buddy's buffer
        (chat window).

        'clear';;  clear the current buddy chat window                  
        'top';;    jump to the top of the current buddy chat buffer     
        'bottom';; jump to the bottom of the current buddy chat buffer  

/clear::
        The 'clear' command is actually an alias for "/buffer clear".

/del::
        Delete the current buddy from our roster, unsubscribe from its presence
        notification and unsubscribe it from ours.

/group fold|unfold|toggle::
        The 'group' command changes the current group display.

        'fold';; fold (shrink) the current group tree in the roster
        'unfold';; unfold (expand) the current group tree in the roster
        'toggle';; toggle the state (fold/unfold) of the current tree

/info::
        Display info on the selected entry (user, agent, group...).

/move [groupname]::
        Move the current buddy to the requested group.  If no group is
        specified, then the buddy is moved to the default group.
        This command only works with users (not agents), at the moment.

/msay begin|send|abort::
        Send a multi-line message.  To write a single message with several
        lines, the 'multi-line mode' should be used.  In multi-line mode,
        each line (except command lines) typed in the input line will
        be added to the multi-line message.  Once the message is finished, it
        can be sent to the current selected buddy with the "msay /send"
        command.

        'begin';; enter multi-line mode
        'send';; send the current multi-line message to the currently selected buddy
        'abort';; leave multi-line mode without sending the message

/quit::
        Disconnect and leave `mcabber(1)`.

/rename nickname::
        Rename current buddy to the given nickname.
        This command does not work for groups, at the moment (but you can move
        the buddies to another group with the /move command).

/roster hide_offline|show_offline|top|bottom::
        The 'roster' command manipulates the roster/buddylist.

        'hide_offline';; hide offline buddies
        'show_offline';; show offline buddies
        'top';;          jump to the top of the roster
        'bottom';;       jump to the bottom of the roster
        'unread_first';; jump to the first unread message
        'unread_next';;  jump to the next unread message

/say text::
        Send the text message to the currently selected buddy.  Can be useful
        if you want to send a message beginning with a slash, for example.

/status [online|avail|invisible|free|dnd|busy|notavail|away]::
        Set the current status.  If no status is specified, display the
        current status.
