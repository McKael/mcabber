Well, the documentation is missing yet, but...

!!!!!! SEE mcabberrc.example !!!!!!

A configuration file is necessary.
Its name is $HOME/.mcabber/mcabberrc (or $HOME/.mcabberrc).
Please see the sample config file!

You can use the -f option to specify another configuration file.


This software is under development, please give me some feedback (and some
patches if you can!).  Or just tell me you're using it... ;-)
